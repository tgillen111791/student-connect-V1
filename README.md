This is the prototype that we showed at Exploration Place and will be the basis of v1 of our app. 

An easy way to run this app on Linux or OSX is to open up the command
terminal and navigate to the correct directory. Type the command
~$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer [portnumber]
to start a web server. The port number is optional but the default is 
8000 which is the same port number that the app engine server uses so 
it is best to choose a port number like 8080. Once the server is running
go to a browser and type
http://localhost:8080
